I am Tom치s Ruiz-L칩pez. I am a software engineer currently working at the [Cancer Registry of Norway](http://kreftregisteret.no/ "Cancer Registry of Norway") as a Postdoctoral Researcher. I am also the Software Design Manager at [Everyware Technologies](http://www.everywaretech.es/ "Everyware Technologies"), where I mainly do Android development, and a little bit of iOS.

I got a B.Sc. in Computer Science in the [University of Granada](http://www.ugr.es/ "University of Granada"). While I was studying there, I got the chance to spend an awesome year in the [University of California, Irvine](http://uci.edu/ "University of California, Irvine").

Later, I received a M.Sc. in Software Engineering and a Ph.D. in Information and Communication Technologies, both from the University of Granada. I spent 3 months at the [University of Texas at Dallas](http://www.utdallas.edu/ "University of Texas at Dallas") as a visiting researcher. In 2013, I got the National Award of Computer Science by the Spanish Ministry of Education.

I hope you enjoy the contents of this blog and feel free to [contact](/contact/) me.
