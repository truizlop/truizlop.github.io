Some months ago, I read [Roman Nurik](http://roman.nurik.net/)'s post on Medium, titled [Walk then talk](https://medium.com/google-developers/walk-then-talk-3b935bfe5484) and I couldn't agree more. The article is not too long, so I recommend you to read it, but if you are still lazy, the main advice he gives is the following

> 1. Make *Really Cool Thing™* with **Platform**.
> 2. Share source for *Really Cool Thing™*.
> 3. Blog, tweet, and talk about *Really Cool Thing™*, how you made it, all the decisions along the way, and most importantly, how **Platform** enables *Really Cool Thing™* to exist in the first place.
> 4. Rinse and repeat.
<cite>Roman Nurik</cite>

So lately, I have been trying to walk a lot to be able to talk about something that may be interesting to you. That's why I decided to create this blog: to share and give back to the community what I have been learning during all this time. I hope you find it useful.

Welcome on board!
