Following up the nice post by Pablo Guardiola titled [Must-have Mac OS X Apps](http://pguardiola.com/blog/must-have-mac-os-x-apps/), I decided to add my 2 cents and write a blog post with some apps which are very helpful in my daily life as a software developer, besides the ones he already recommended in his blog.

## Transmit

[Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/ "Transmit") is a nice FTP/SFTP/S3/WebDAV client. I used to use [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) before, but Transmit has a much cleaner UI and its look and feel is more integrated with OS X.

## Coda

If besides uploading files to your server you would like to edit some text files on the fly without worrying to download, open them in a text editor, saving and uploading them again, then [Coda](https://panic.com/coda/ "Coda") is your tool. It becomes specially useful if you are editing web-related files thanks to its syntax highlighting.

## GitHub

Although there are tools more powerful than this, the official [GitHub](https://mac.github.com/ "GitHub") app always comes handy to commit and push changes to your GitHub repositories.

## Android Tool

I mainly do Android development and sometimes the official tools are terrible when you have to take a screenshot or record a video of your device. Fortunately, around one month ago, I discovered [Android Tool](https://github.com/mortenjust/androidtool-mac "Android Tool"), which aims to simplify all these tasks. It also enables to install APK files from your Mac onto your Android device. Also, the project is open source, so if you find a bug or want to add a new feature, it will be nice.

## Handbrake

Have you ever had to convert videos to the appropriate format so they can be played on your device? [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/ "Handbrake") has always been helpful for me. The project is open source too, and I really like the cocktail icon!

## Latexian

Last, but not least, I have always hated MS Word, and never got used to Pages. Besides, I have had to write many research papers while pursuing my Ph.D., so I got used to writing in _LaTeX_ (which is kind of hipster I guess... I usually feel like I am sort of programing a text). After trying many different tools, I found [Latexian](http://tacosw.com/latexian/download.php "Latexian"). The thing I like the most about it is that you can actually see a live preview of the document you are editing at the moment. Unfortunately, I just discovered that the company developing it ran out of business and it won't receive more support.

There are much more useful apps than these (for instance, I am using [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/ "MacDown") to edit this post) and I would love to hear from you about your favorites, so leave a comment below!
